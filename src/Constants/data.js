In \naddition to direct B2B sales, there are multiple income streams \nto be exploited: 1) Bundling into solutions offered by the \nrecruitment industry, 2) Establishing TeamPlayerHR ID as a B2C \nsolution for inclusion into online business platforms (e.g. Linked \nIn), 3) establishing a TeamPlayerHR job portal that embeds the ID \ninto the process. \nBusiness Model: A highly scalable and efficient business that \nmaximises the TeamPlayerHR web portal and online \nquestionnaire.
